Native iOS application 

Track your efforts to see the compound impact on your environment protection!

Green Butterfly helps users visualize how their "small" eco-friendly actions compound 
and make a difference. GB does this by allowing users to track &amp; 
tally their efforts while providing insights about energy saved!

Green Butterfly V2.0 aims to keep users engaged in challenging themselves through a point 
system, in order to allow for local leaderboards, refreshed weekly, and challenges between friends
and family.
